Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index.

Series acts very similarly to a ndarray, and is a valid argument to most NumPy functions. However, things like slicing also slice the index.

A Series is like a fixed-size dict in that you can get and set values by index label:

A key difference between Series and ndarray is that operations between Series automatically align the data based on label.

The integrated data alignment features of the pandas data structures set pandas apart from the majority of related tools for working with labeled data.


DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects.

2-dimensional heterogonous array.

 DataFrames in Python are very similar: they come with the Pandas library, and they are defined as a two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types.

Besides data, you can also specify the index and column names for your DataFrame. The index, on the one hand, indicates the difference in rows, while the column names indicate the difference in columns.
